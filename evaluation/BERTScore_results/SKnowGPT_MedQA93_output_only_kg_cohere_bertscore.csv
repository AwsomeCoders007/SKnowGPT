Possible side effects of Topiramate include rash, shortness of breath, uncontrollable shaking, nervousness, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, chest pain, constipation, loss of appetite, blurred vision, excessive tiredness, stomach pain, drowsiness, diarrhea, fever, confusion, weakness, dry mouth, weight loss, difficulty urinating, leg pain, memory problems, eye pain, back pain, unusual bleeding, loss of coordination, double vision, numbness, nosebleed, burning or tingling in hands or feet, slowed reactions, uncontrollable eye movements, change in ability to taste food, bone pain, missed menstrual periods, excessive menstrual bleeding, loss of vision, eye redness, worsening of seizures, pounding or irregular heartbeat, intense back pain, and bruising.
