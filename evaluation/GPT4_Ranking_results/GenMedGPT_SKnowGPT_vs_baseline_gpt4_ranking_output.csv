Recommended medications include fluoride supplements and hearing aids. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to replace the stapes bone in the ear.

","As an AI doctor, I recommend that you undergo the following medical tests for Otosclerosis:

1. Audiogram: This test measures your hearing ability and can help determine the extent of hearing loss caused by Otosclerosis.

2. Tympanometry: This test evaluates the movement of your eardrum and can help identify any abnormalities in the middle ear.

3. CT scan or MRI: Imaging tests like a CT scan or MRI can provide detailed images of the structures in your ear and help confirm the diagnosis of Otosclerosis.

4. Vestibular testing: Since you are experiencing occasional dizziness, vestibular testing may be recommended to assess your balance function and rule out any inner ear disorders.

It is important to follow your ENT specialist's recommendations and undergo these tests to determine the best treatment plan for your Otosclerosis.","['Otosclerosis need medical test Ophthalmologic and otologic diagnosis and treatment Excision (Removal) Ophthalmic examination and evaluation (Eye exam) Corneal transplant Procedures on spleen (Spleen operation) Removal of ectopic pregnancy Tracheostomy; temporary and permanent', 'Otosclerosis has symptom Dizziness Diminished hearing Emotional symptoms Elbow weakness Ear pain Underweight Plugged feeling in ear Wrist weakness Muscle swelling Low back weakness Elbow cramps or spasms Nailbiting', 'Otosclerosis need medication Calcium Citrate Niacin Ibandronate (Boniva) Phenytoin (Dilantin) Droperidol Calcium Carbonate Ezetimibe (Zetia) Celecoxib (Celebrex) Clozapine Meclizine', 'Dizziness possible disease Panic disorder Headache after lumbar puncture Sick sinus syndrome Tinnitus of unknown cause Transient ischemic attack Atelectasis Thoracic aortic aneurysm Subdural hemorrhage Mastoiditis Lung contusion Pulmonary eosinophilia Stroke Normal pressure hydrocephalus Nonalcoholic liver disease (NASH) Intracranial hemorrhage Hyperkalemia Atrial fibrillation Conductive hearing loss Presbyacusis Protein deficiency Heart block Magnesium deficiency Otosclerosis Vasculitis Concussion Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) Myasthenia gravis Hypoglycemia Carbon monoxide poisoning Panic attack Hiatal hernia Meniere disease Hypercalcemia Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH) Mitral valve disease Parkinson disease Acute kidney injury Gastrointestinal hemorrhage Poisoning due to antihypertensives Tension headache Labyrinthitis Drug reaction Adrenal cancer Chronic rheumatic fever Esophageal varices Ectopic pregnancy Drug withdrawal Polycythemia vera Anemia of chronic disease Encephalitis Alcohol withdrawal Premature atrial contractions (PACs) Meningioma Vertebrobasilar insufficiency Benign paroxysmal positional vertical (BPPV) Intracerebral hemorrhage Atrial flutter Orthostatic hypotension Hypokalemia Primary thrombocythemia Sensorineural hearing loss Poisoning due to anticonvulsants Hydatidiform mole Pain disorder affecting the neck Pelvic fistula Dementia Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia Poisoning due to gas Persistent vomiting of unknown cause Myocarditis Ischemic heart disease Iron deficiency anemia Autonomic nervous system disorder Anemia Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia Diabetes insipidus Migraine Lewy body dementia Head injury Somatization disorder Hypovolemia Endocarditis Heat stroke Sinus bradycardia Malignant hypertension Heat exhaustion Essential tremor Subarachnoid hemorrhage Eustachian tube dysfunction (ear disorder) Graves disease Hyperemesis gravidarum Epidural hemorrhage Vitamin B deficiency Arrhythmia Trigeminal neuralgia Peripheral nerve disorder Poisoning due to antipsychotics Cerebral edema Multiple sclerosis Pneumoconiosis Angina Hyponatremia Spinocerebellar ataxia Acute stress reaction Guillain Barre syndrome Poisoning due to opioids Pseudotumor cerebri']","1.

","**Answer:**
I'm sorry to hear that you've been having trouble sleeping. Primary insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, without any underlying medical or psychiatric condition causing it. 

Here are some tips that may help improve your sleep:

1. Establish a bedtime routine: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps regulate your body's internal clock.

2. Create a comfortable sleep environment: Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Consider using earplugs or a white noise machine if noise is a problem.

3. Limit screen time before bed: The blue light emitted by screens can interfere with your body's production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep. Try to avoid screens at least an hour before bedtime.

4. Avoid caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime: Both can disrupt your sleep patterns, so try to avoid them in the hours leading up to bedtime.

5. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing, meditation, or progressive muscle relaxation can help calm your mind and body before bed.
