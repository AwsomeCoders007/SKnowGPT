    Your symptoms might be related to your asthma, but they could also indicate other conditions, such as a heart issue or stress. \
    To be thorough, we'll review your asthma management and run a few tests, including a lung function test, an ECG, and a \
    complete blood count (CBC). This will help us rule out other possible causes and ensure we address any concerns effectively.

    The dosages are 500 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily and 0.4 mg of tamsulosin once daily, and the treatment duration in the study was 6 weeks.
